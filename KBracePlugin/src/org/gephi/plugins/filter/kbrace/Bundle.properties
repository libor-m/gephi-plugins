OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    The k-brace filter is a variant of the k-core. \
    Instead of the degree it uses the edge's embededness (number of common neighbors). \
    It is useful to highlight dense connected components in social networks. \
    The filter works only on undirected graphs.\n\n\
    As defined in the paper "the k-brace of a graph is the subgraph formed by repeatedly\ndeleting all edges of embeddedness less than k and then deleting all single-node connected components"\n\n<b>Reference:</b>\nStructural diversity in social contagion\nJohan Ugander, Lars Backstrom, Cameron Marlow, and Jon Kleinberg\nPNAS (2012)\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/03/27/1116502109.full.pdf
OpenIDE-Module-Name=KBracePlugin

KBraceFilter.name = K-brace
KBraceFilter.description = Recursively deletes edges which both nodes have less than K common neighbors. Also removes all isolates.
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=K-brace filter which removes less embedded edges
